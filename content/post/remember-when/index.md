Can you remember what it was like to be five-years-old? Running around the playground, innocently chasing a meaningless crush. Rolling down on a grassy hill that you’re already getting ready to run back up. Memories start to resurface. Perhaps there’s a funny story from kindergarten you know by heart, whether it’s because you actually remember or it’s a story your guardian liked to share. For some, maybe early childhood was either a blur or something you don’t want to remember.

For me, sweet little nothings come up when I think of my time in kindergarten. Somewhat vaguely, I recall one day where the class had show-and-tell. It was a day full of excitement and nerves, if I remember correctly. Excitement for bringing something I loved at the time to show with my peers (it was a small Powerpuff doll named Blossom). Nerves for sharing something my peers would think was dumb, or worse, simply weren’t interested in. Show-and-tell was such a major moment for five-year-old Maia, yet this is likely a moment only I remember at this point in time. Other students and my teacher had their own experiences to recall from that day, and so I doubt anyone else fully remembers what I brought to show-and-tell nineteen years ago. At least, that’s what I would infer.

Of course, this moment was only a small facet of that particular day. Was what I felt during show-and-tell truly the result of bringing a small doll to class? Or is there more to the story than what I can recall? As a student of developmental psychology, I know that this period of my life was rife with change and growth. Yet, I consciously remember an insignificant fraction of what I experienced. That fraction of a fraction is imbued with doubt and ambiguity, so that it’s tough to say what was actually true in the moment. Perhaps, maybe the adults who were involved in your life remember more than you expect, or at least, remember more than you ever could.

If my kindergarten teacher could remember me, would she be surprised of the person I am today? Was the small slice of life she saw me for, amidst a sea of other kids, enough to foretell the adult I eventually grew to be? 

This past year, I worked part-time as an instructional aide in a kindergarten class featuring one nearly retired teacher, a community volunteer, 25 students, and a rotating cast of classroom parents. Despite the number of adults in the classroom, the students never ceased to surprise us each day. We were faced with a mix of children who either did or did not have prior experience in a classroom setting, or even being in a large group with their peers. Most, if not all, of these students lived through a worldwide quarantine at the age of three. These considerations don’t even take into account the daily variables every individual child (and teacher) navigated. You could tell when one student had poor sleep that night, or when another was anxious about troubles at home. Reactions to typical parts of the class routine would change drastically that day, and patterns in behavior would begin to emerge.

Each student was unique. Preferences, learning style, thoughts, actions, background… you name it. However, one thing was universal: all students had developed in some way socially and emotionally. Whether the development further reinforced adaptive or maladaptive behaviors and thought patterns, or spurred new ones, each and every individual student were keen observers of their surroundings. It’s hard to fully summarize the patterns I saw, as some much inter- and intra-variability occurred on a minute-by-minute, day-by-day, and month-by-month basis. Yet, as mentioned earlier, patterns did emerge. Prediction of student behavior was possible. The key to prediction was continued involvement in the classroom setting, seeing full sequences of interaction unfold in real time, and observing all agents in the classroom, including both adults and children.

It was a great privilege to work in a classroom full of growing humans. Each day I spent supporting the teacher and the students, I walked away with a dozen stories. As much as I would like to share them, these moments should be held private to those they involve. All I can say is my experience helped re-establish the wonderment I had as a child, and it gave way to newfound appreciation for the teachers, parents, and everyone else who supported me in my educational journey.

To conclude, further introspection will shed some light on the full circumstances surrounding my show-and-tell on that fateful day in 2004. Most of that data is lost to time, but one of the greatest endeavors I can engage in is to recapture time and memory in hopes of pushing forward the knowledge of today.
