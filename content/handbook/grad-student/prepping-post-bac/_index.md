Whether or not you have decided on graduate school, seeking out professional experiences can inform your understanding of how a field works and what it may take to succeed in that professional context. Yet, multiple barriers may arise for the aspiring professional based on your current personal, academic, and financial situation. 

The resources I have found most helpful were either ones I leveraged during my undergraduate experience or I wish I had knowledge of when I was searching for work opportunities. These will be provided below. There is a hidden curriculum in academia, and while this isn't a single person's fault, some individuals get exposed to this curriculum sooner than others. On a related note, check out Margaret Echelbarger's [newsletter](https://letstalkgradschool.substack.com/) and [social media](https://bsky.app/profile/bskybymidge.bsky.social) for some more hidden curriculum content.
