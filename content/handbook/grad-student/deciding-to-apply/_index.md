## Exploring Career Paths & Finding Direction

I left my undergraduate career confident in my research ability, but unsure of what would be my next step. The first half of 2021, I was consistently applying to full-time positions, such as lab manager, research associates, legal assistants, and countless others. I was getting rejected constantly, but eventually managed to get offered one low-paying legal assistant role in NYC. After a few months, I had to leave my position to move back to the west coast during a family crisis. After some bereavement, I went back on the job hunt and eventually found a new market research role alongside part-time applied work.

I outlined my post-undergraduate experience because it was scattered, yet necessary in identifying my life and professional priorities. Over that two year gap between undergraduate and graduate school, I considered numerous paths outside of academia that would best utilize my research skills and psychological understanding. I’ve outlined the possible paths below, in additional to optional/required advanced degrees needed for the roles:

1. **Public & Social Policy:** A career in [social policy](https://www.lse.ac.uk/social-policy/about-us/What-is-social-policy) leverages research skills in policy development and programming for the goal of supporting a broader population of people. Further training can include pursuing a Master’s of Public Policy (MPP) or Public Administration, a dual MPP/Ph.D. program, or exploring other advanced degrees in the social sciences (e.g., economics, population sciences, sociology, public health, and more). A helpful guide on a career in public policy can be found [here](https://research.com/careers/public-policy-careers).
2. **Education:** Working in the education field, whether it’s K-12 or higher education, is an excellent way to further understanding of human development and learning. Areas of job opportunity in education include administration, teaching, programming, advising, school counseling, and much more. The type of training or educational pre-requisites needed to enter this field is dependent on the role; required degrees can range from teaching credential, bachelor’s or master’s degree in education, Ph.D. in educational policy, or to no degree at all.
3. ***Clinical Work:***
    1. **School Psychology:** School psychology is a more applied psychology extension of working in the K-12 educational system. [School psychologists](https://www.nasponline.org/about-school-psychology/who-are-school-psychologists) support schools in assessing students, developing behavioral and academic plans, and many other responsibilities depending on the school and district. I’ve found that this YouTuber, [Tiffany Lee](https://www.youtube.com/@TiffanyLee), provides excellent videos on what a career in school psychology looks like, and what it takes to get there. **A master’s (Ed.M./Ed.S.) or Ph.D. is needed (learn more on pre-requisites [here](**https://www.psychology.org/careers/school-psychologist/))**.
    2. **Speech-Language Pathology:** Another opportunity for clinical training is becoming a [speech-language pathologist](https://www.asha.org/public/who-are-speech-language-pathologists/) (SLP). SLPs can work with people across a wide range of ages, and specialize in language and social-emotional development. SLPs can find themselves working a variety of contexts, such as schools, private practice, hospitals, and more.  **A master’s (Ed.M./Ed.S.) is needed (learn more on pre-requisites [here](**https://www.indeed.com/career-advice/career-development/how-to-become-a-speech-pathologist))**.
4. **Legal Studies:** Becoming a lawyer requires skills, such as researching and working with people, which you may develop in your time studying psychology. Working in the legal field grants can lead to highly impactful work, especially when it comes to civil rights, family law, immigration rights, and more. Check out the areas of law you can specialize in [here](https://www.lsac.org/discover-law/types-law-programs/fields-law). Pursuing a career in law would most likely necessitate an advanced degree, such as a J.D., Master’s of Legal Studies (MLS), or dual J.D./Ph.D..
5. ***Research:***
    1. **Nonprofits & Think-Tanks:** This section somewhat relates back to a [career path in public policy](https://research.com/careers/public-policy-careers). Nonprofit organizations can vary greatly by services they provide and the issues they cover in their work. Depending on the funding and prestige of a nonprofit organization, roles can be more [generalist](https://www.indeed.com/hire/c/info/generalist-definition) or highly specialized. Further information can be found [here](https://career.ucsf.edu/phds/career-paths/non-profit).
    2. **Market Research:** Compared to the other career paths mentioned, market research has a much lower barrier to entry, and it can be a well-compensated career path even starting as an entry-level employee. Market research entails conducting studies, data collection, and analyzing data on various topics to create research reports and products that are sold to interested customers or to inform business strategy. More information on a career in market research can be found [here](https://www.blackridgeresearch.com/blog/thinking-of-a-job-career-in-market-research).

### The Process of Career Pathing & Choosing a PhD

What’s listed above is only a portion of what you can do with a background in developmental psychology. Below are some helpful resources on choosing a career and developing a career plan based on your interests and background. After you develop an initial plan, be open to any changes that may arise in your life. Priorities change over time, and things you can’t predict may pop up. Be flexible with your professional trajectory, and frequently evaluate you’re on the right path that makes sense for you. If you settle on one career path and then realize it’s not for you, there will always be an opportunity to change course.
