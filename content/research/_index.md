## Providing the Framework: A Hop, Skip, & Jump
Sometimes the questions worth asking are the ones to which we think we already know the answer. Let's explore the ones below:

* Do you still believe you are a good person even when you don't make good choices all of the time? 

* Does this belief change when we think about the ones closest to us? How about total strangers?

* What does it even mean to make a good, or moral, choice?

* Does this meaning change across situations, relationships, and age? If yes, then how?

For most of the above questions, you could easily begin your answer with one of three responses: "Yes", "No", and (every psychology students' favorite answer), "It depends." 

Now, consider how these responses may differ if you were to ask your closest friend. There would probably not be much difference between the two of you. Well... what about if we were to ask a young niece or nephew? Or perhaps an elderly neighbor? Would the answers start to diverge? Or would everyone answer the same? We could continue asking these questions within an expanding, hypothetical social circle, taking into consideration age and other factors which can impact perceptions of others.

This thought experiment may turn into a celebration of common ground... or illuminate key differences in how we all come to understand morality and what it means to be a good person.


## Where to Begin as a Researcher?
I aim to contribute to the ever-evolving field of psychology by seeking out how processes within moral development are understood and can be studied. With the previous section in mind, my research interests are rooted in the following questions:

- How do we come to understand ourselves and others as moral persons?

- What processes underlie the development of our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons?

- How does our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons shift from social contexts, relational contexts, and major developmental periods?

- How does the understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons inform broader identity development?


## Why Dedicate a Career to This Topic?

{{< spoiler text="**Widespread Applied Value**" >}}
Discussing what it means to be a good person doesn't have to be left to moral philosophers and scholars. Fully elaborating on what it takes to make moral choices and how we come to understand this about ourselves and others has far-reaching applications. Moral development and all of its latent processes underscore numerous dynamics and contexts in our everyday lives. This ranges from business ethics ([DeTienne et al., 2019](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10551-019-04351-0)), education ([Nucci & Turiel, 2009](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1751-228X.2009.01065.x?casa_token=HuMRVrhtvnwAAAAA%3AvpXl6tyweOUpyr--TcCab6tuatYLWghnVscYzJvVe5CRKKcgs7Br5prMxVQrXFE6Gaph2OMHWVo-)), navigating interpersonal relationships ([Sirota, 2019](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6606994/)), understanding economic behavior and navigating social systems ([Hajnal, Z. 2020](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-030-52673-3_5)), and technological innovation ([Danaher & Saetra, 2022](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10676-022-09661-y)).

{{< spoiler text="**Step in the Right (Research) Direction**" >}}
When hearing about moral development, a fellow student of psychology may remember learning about [Jean Piaget](https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget-moral.html) and [Lawrence Kohlberg](https://www.simplypsychology.org/kohlberg.html) in their undergraduate social development course. What's exciting to say is that there have been monumental waves in moral development research in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century and exciting new research directions are on the rise. Ranging from new theories and re-visiting old concepts (e.g., [Social Domain Theory](https://www.socialdomaintheory.com/), [moral agency](https://ethicsunwrapped.utexas.edu/glossary/moral-agent), [moral identity](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2011-21882-019), etc.) to the rise of notable moral developmentalists in the public eye (e.g., [Carol Gilligan](https://www.verywellmind.com/the-carol-gilligan-theory-and-a-woman-s-sense-of-self-5198408) and [Paul Bloom](https://paulbloom.net/)) and less public (but just as important, or even more so) developmentalists (e.g., [Melanie Killen](https://nacs.umd.edu/facultyprofile/killen/melanie), [Elliot Turiel](https://bse.berkeley.edu/elliot-turiel), [Cecilia Wainryb](https://psych.utah.edu/people/faculty/wainryb-cecilia.php), and many more), moral development as a field of study has expanded its scope and impact. 

However, the scientific study of moral development is still in its early phases. We are less than one hundred years since the Cognitive Revolution and the expansion of developmental studies in the mid-twentieth century (Dixon, 2001; [Miller, 2003](https://www.cs.princeton.edu/~rit/geo/Miller.pdf)). This is a relatively short amount of time when compared to the entirety of human history. Yes, philosophers have been pontificating on the nature and origins of morality for centuries, but true, rigorous experimental and observational data collection on this topic is a modern phenomenon. This is an area ripe for growth while in need of adapting to the quick advances in quantitative methods and technology taking on the social sciences more broadly.

{{< spoiler text="**Methodology & Innovation**" >}}
Exceptional care in methodology and analysis is what transforms a good idea into meaningful research. This is why methodological innovation is fundamental to the ontogenesis of knowledge within psychology. From the distant days of early 20th century psychoanalysis, the field of psychology has quickly evolved into multiple disciplines, largely due to the dialectical nature of methodological and theoretical innovation. The foundations of psychological inquiry were built on the clinical observations recorded by Freud and his school, but true growth in the field of psychology was spurred by interdisciplinary methodological learnings in the mid- and late-20th century. These include discoveries from biology, anthropology, physics, chemistry, and mathematics, all of which have informed psychologists in evaluating inferential statistics and mathematical theory, qualitative research, experimental methods, and theory development.

Centering quantitative methods, theory, and methodological development in my research will be critical in understanding the processes underlying moral development in all of their complexity ([click here to learn more about studying complexity in psychology](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/)). Modern approaches in studying a variety of psychological topics, such as emotion regulation ([Lewis et al., 1999]([https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/sites/psycwww/files/uploaded_files/Faculty/Tom Hollenstein/GridWare/Lewis_Lamey__Douglas_1999.pdf](https://www.queensu.ca/psychology/sites/psycwww/files/uploaded_files/Faculty/Tom%20Hollenstein/GridWare/Lewis_Lamey__Douglas_1999.pdf))), theory of mind ([Lagattuta et al., 2016](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/27017060/)), cognitive and sensorimotor development ([Thelen & Smith, 2007](https://cogdev.sitehost.iu.edu/labwork/handbook.pdf)), and social-personality psychology ([Jackson & Beck, 2021](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/emoriebeck/home/master/static/files/Jackson-2021-JG.pdf)), could be applied in studying moral development processes. These processes can include exploring moral identity, reasoning, judgment, evaluation, and more.

Ultimately, I want to determine whether applying [dynamical systems theory](https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~butner/systems/DynamicalSystemsIntro.html), both conceptually and analytically, to moral development is a worthwhile research endeavor. I believe that DST concepts can explain how conceptions of the self (e.g., identity) can change and re-organize over time, along with how conceptions of others shift over time and across context, specifically within the realm of moral development. This intersection of interests is not the first of its kind. Contemporary researchers such as Drs. [Minkang Kim](https://www.sydney.edu.au/arts/about/our-people/academic-staff/minkang-kim.html), [Derek Sankey](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Derek-Sankey), [Ulas Kaplan](https://lesley.edu/about/faculty-staff-directory/ulas-kaplan), and others have contributed to this topic.

{{< spoiler text="**Privilege & Gratitude**" >}}
Last, but not least, it is a great privilege to pursue a higher education degree wherein I can advance our knowledge of developmental psychology. Many great, contemporary scientists are ultimately pushed to leave academia, either due to financial, cultural, personal, or other professional considerations. The time I spend studying moral development, I plan to leave a mark and to learn all that I can with the time and privilege I have.

## Curious? Keep Reading.

Further in this section, my research interests are presented in a fashion much like that of a typical research paper, from an introduction on core topics I'm interested in to avenues to exploring these topics and the considerations and challenges that go alongside them.

While I am at the start of my academic career, you can access my prior undergraduate work in childcare policy and subjective interpretation in the [publications section](/publications/).
