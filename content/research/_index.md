*"The more you know yourself, the more patience you have for what you see in others".*  **-Erik H. Erikson**


## Guiding Research Questions

1. How do we come to understand ourselves and others as moral persons?

2. What processes underlie the development of our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons?

3. How does our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons shift from social contexts, relational contexts, and major developmental periods?

4. How does the understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons inform broader identity development?

In this section, my research interests are presented in a fashion much like that of a typical research paper, from an introduction on core topics I'm interested in to avenues to exploring these topics and the considerations and challenges that go alongside them.

While I am at the start of my academic career, you can access my prior undergraduate work in childcare policy and subjective interpretation in the [publications section](/publications/).

# Research Foundation

My research background ranges from strictly psychological roots to  narrative identity to socio-emotional development to federal policy and talent acquisition market research.
