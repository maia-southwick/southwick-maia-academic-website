## Providing the Framework: A Hop, Skip, & Jump
Sometimes the questions worth asking are the ones to which we think we already know the answer. Let's explore the ones below:

* Do you still believe you are a good person even when you don't make good choices all of the time? 

* Does this belief change when we think about the ones closest to us? How about total strangers?

* What does it even mean to make a good, or moral, choice?

* Does this meaning change across situations, relationships, and age? If yes, then how?

For most of the above questions, you could easily begin your answer with one of three responses: "Yes", "No", and (every psychology students' favorite answer), "It depends." 

Now, consider how these responses may differ if you were to ask your closest friend. There would probably not be much difference between the two of you. Well... what about if we were to ask an elderly relative? Or perhaps a young niece or nephew? Would the answers start to diverge? Or would everyone answer the same? We could continue asking these questions within an expanding, hypothetical social circle, of which could eventually include those we do not relate to at all.

This thought experiment may turn into a celebration of common ground... or illuminate key differences in how we all come to understand morality and what it means to be a good person.


## Where to Begin as a Researcher?
I aim to contribute to the ever-evolving field of psychology by seeking out how processes within moral development are understood and can be studied. With the previous section in mind, my research interests are rooted in the following questions:

- How do we come to understand ourselves and others as moral persons?

- What processes underlie the development of our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons?

- How does our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons shift from social contexts, relational contexts, and major developmental periods?

- How does the understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons inform broader identity development?

Further in this section, my research interests are presented in a fashion much like that of a typical research paper, from an introduction on core topics I'm interested in to avenues to exploring these topics and the considerations and challenges that go alongside them.

While I am at the start of my academic career, you can access my prior undergraduate work in childcare policy and subjective interpretation in the [publications section](/publications/).
