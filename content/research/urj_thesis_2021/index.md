abstract: Individuals can walk away from interpersonal conflict with divergent interpretations of what occurred. A critical component of these different interpretations of past conflict is whether we felt heard by the other afterwards. This thesis sought to explore the experience of feeling heard and to bridge this phenomenon with broader interpersonal and developmental implications. We compared these experiences across relational contexts as previous research has shown different types of relationships evoke different expectations, behaviors, and narrative accounts from individuals. We coded sets of narratives detailing times when participants (N = 189) felt heard and did not feel heard following disagreements with either their mother, father, close friend, or romantic partner. These narratives were provided by participants between 18 and 29 years old (i.e. emerging adults). Three a priori hypotheses were made predicting the prevalence of certain interactional features (e.g. validation, power, compliance, repair, dismissal, continuation of conflict, and withdrawal) between the two narrative conditions. Our hypotheses were well-supported by the data collected, except in the case of compliance. First, validation, power, and repair occurred more frequently in narratives of times participants felt heard. Second, dismissal, continuation of conflict, and withdrawal occurred more frequently in narratives of times participants did not feel heard. Finally, repair occurred more frequently in feeling heard narratives for peer contexts than parent contexts. Our findings provide evidence for the continued distinction of parent and peer contexts into emerging adulthood. Research on further distinguishing the role of specific relational contexts in feeling heard is recommended.
