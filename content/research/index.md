## Guiding Questions

1. How do individuals come to understand others and themselves as moral persons?
2. What processes underlie the development of our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons?
3. How does our understanding of ourselves and others as moral persons shift from social contexts, relational contexts, and across major developmental periods?**
4. Can change occur outside of typical developmental processes in our understandings  of ourselves and others as moral persons? What does it take?
5. How does the understanding of ourselves and others as moral agents inform broader identity development?
