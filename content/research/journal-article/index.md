abstract: Recent federal regulations sought to increase funding for subsidizing qualified child care arrangements in order to promote access to affordable child care among low-income families. Access to child care is associated with promoting economic mobility and positive development among children. However, only a quarter of all eligible children in the United States received subsidized child care in 2016. This paper seeks to provide an overview of current child care policy and to explore the factors that may contribute to the deficit in participation in subsidy use among eligible low-income families. Understanding these factors can inform community outreach, application processes, and overall increasing access to social welfare resources. Factors include nontraditional work schedules, full time work, relying on relatives for child care, state funding priorities, and general lack of knowledge or discouragement of the application process. An important question for lawmakers to consider upon this analysis is whether focus should be given to either more comprehensive, inclusive child care policy or more sustainable, targeted policy.
