*To know the direction my research will take, it's best to know the academic and professional conditions I was exposed in my early career.*

---

My research background ranges from strictly academic, studying topics such as narrative identity and socio-emotional development, to heavily applied contexts, including federal policy and talent acquisition market research. This exposure to a rich variety of subjects was due to a mix of self-exploration and determination to gain "real world" experience as a future academic researcher. To begin an intensive career in psychology research, it is important to have a thorough understanding of the critical contexts of which human development occurs in. This belief is the north star to which I align my research goals. 

In this section, I will be outlining key concepts I've learned throughout my undergraduate experience up until I began my graduate school career. Click through each drop-down below for an overview of relevant research and resources.

### Dynamical Systems
{{< spoiler text="**Overview**" >}}
In the midst of finishing up my first graduate course in quantitative methods, my then professor advertised for a course he was teaching the following semester. It was called, “Dynamical Systems Theory”, and, as [Jonathan Butner](https://psych.utah.edu/people/faculty/butner-jonathan.php) described it, if we enjoyed this quant class, we’ll probably enjoy this new course. It wasn’t taught frequently, and so this was likely my only chance to be exposed to the topic in a classroom setting. After the announcement, I was convinced this was the next step in deepening my understanding of quantitative methods as an undergraduate.

In spite of the onset of a worldwide pandemic, I learned a great deal about dynamical systems theory in spring of 2020([see here for class syllabus](https://psych.utah.edu/_resources/documents/people/systems-course-syllabus-2020.pdf)). Dynamical systems theory incorporates time and space in its modeling of complex phenomena, or more specifically, phenomena which emerges from an interaction of lower order parts.

For a more thorough introduction to the core concepts of dynamical systems theory, check out this [webpage here](https://content.csbs.utah.edu/~butner/systems/DynamicalSystemsIntro.html). For topical information related to developmental psychology, I would direct readers first to the key figures who made the initial bridge between developmental psychology and DST, Drs. Esther Thelen and Linda B. Smith. Their work centered around biological self-organization ([Thelen & Smith, 2007](https://cogdev.sitehost.iu.edu/labwork/handbook.pdf)) and infant development.

### Narrative Psychology & Identity
{{< spoiler text="**Overview**" >}}
**Narrative psychology** is centered around storytelling in three ways: (1) as a tool in gathering rich data, (2) as a conceptual framework for understanding the human condition, and (3) as an mechanism involved in numerous developmental, personality, and memory processes (Adler et al. 2017; American Psychological Association, n.d.). For an engaging, easy-to-digest article on narratives, [check this link here](https://www.apa.org/monitor/2011/01/stories).


Introducing the idea of narrative as a scientific approach can be met with hesitance by some. Whether the concern is rooted in fear or dismay, it usually circles back to wariness of the use of "subjectivity" in research. Stories and memories are inherently imbued with some degree of subjectivity, that is a fair enough claim. However, the account and meaning we derive from any event or series of events (past, present, or future) and *how we communicate and process those understandings* can have concrete, objective impacts on ourselves and the world around us (Adler et al., 2017). Past narrative research has explored well-being, emotion regulation, conflict, interpersonal relationships, and more, all of which play major roles in the human experience (Adler et al., 2017; McLean et al., 2020; Baumeister, Stillwell, & Wotman, 1990). Additionally, quantitative methodology has evolved alongside narrative psychology, which allows for robust analytics to extract rich findings and complexities within narrative research.
