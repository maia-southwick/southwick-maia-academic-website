My research background ranges from strictly academic, studying topics such as narrative identity and socio-emotional development, to heavily applied contexts, including federal policy and talent acquisition market research.

This exposure to a rich variety of subjects was due to a mix of self-exploration and determination to gain "real world" experience as a future academic researcher. Studying human behavior and its antecendents is a momentous task. Ultimately, researchers arrive on a single series of topics to thoroughly study. Why? The realm of psychological research continues to be never-ending and a person is restricted on how much they can explore in a single lifetime. Before I myself reach that point of tailored expertise (and before my biological timer runs out), I have been on a mission to scoop up as much diversity in experience as possible. 


In this chapter, I will be outlining key concepts I've learned throughout my undergraduate experience up until I began my graduate school career. Click through each section below or to the left for an overview of relevant research and resources.
